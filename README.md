# Categories API

This app exposes an API to:
 - Get the list of canonical categories used by localistico
 - Get category suggestions based on a list of selected/ignored
   categories (currently suggesting descendants of selected
   categories).

Relevant details:
 - Mapping of platform categories to canonical categories is done
   manually in the [admin backoffice][backoffice].
 - Canonical categories come from Factual list of categories and has
   less resolution than platforms.
 - API is defined with json-schema. [Docs are autogenerated][docs].
 - Go client is auto-generated in
   [github.com/espresso-team/localistico/categories][gopkg].

TODO:
 - Endpoints to transform platform categories to canonical categories
   and viceversa.
 - Better suggestion of categories based on data about how common is for
   categories to go together.
